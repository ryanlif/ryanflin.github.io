## Acknowledgement
My website is built on this [academic website template](https://github.com/lydhr/NextJSAcademicTheme?tab=readme-ov-file](https://nextjs-academic-theme.vercel.app/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Dark/Light mode). Please see their [github](https://github.com/lydhr/NextJSAcademicTheme?tab=readme-ov-file) for more help. The template code is released under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).

Thanks a lot for the great design!
